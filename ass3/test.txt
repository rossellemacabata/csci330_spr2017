Tested queries

These are all the queries I tested in workbench.
I should have piped my outputs to a textfile so you can see my results (for printing and formatting in Java),
but I forgot that we needed a test.txt file to submit, in which I apologize.

I also wasn't sure how to share what my results were from workbench when I would run the queries,
but you can tell that a lot of queries have several mistakes in them and I've created multiple queries 
for the same command...
